My strong education background and journey in data science has equipped me with a robust skill set in diverse programming languages including R, Python, EVIEWS, STATA, machine learning, and robust data analysis.\r\nüïõÔ∏è Over the years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, from health, economic monitoring to climate change and air quality assessment, always with a focus on using data to solve real-world problems. I am passionate about continuous learning and sharing my knowledge, which drives me to mentor aspiring data professionals and contribute to the data science community.\r\n\r\nTalks and Workshops\r\n\r\nI‚Äôve given several talks and workshops, many focused on Air Quality Control and Climate Change, Remote Sensing, Machine Learning and Agriculture and much more. I taught the Air Quality Data Analytics, Statistical Graphics & Visualization course through the Climate Change and Air Quality Monitoring Project at the Rwanda Environment Management Authority, REMA. The course focused on data visualization using R and openair. Last summer, I taught the course of R package development for data management through the Cenfri Rwanda consultancy contract and give seminars at the University of Rwanda in field of Machine Learning applications.\r\n\r\nGrant and Project Leading\r\n\r\nThe UNESCO offered us the research grant to implement the schooling project title Pollution Mitigation Strategies and Digital Air Quality Monitoring at Secondary School and TVET in Rwanda: Pilot study of Kigali City. We have delivered the developed application used to monitor the air quality status through the color code indices as recommended by US-EPA. Here you can access the SANO application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: You can find more works and tutorials on my personal website, and from my blog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
