- Data science has been revealed as the *sexiest job of the 21st century*,
- This is not just a hyperbolic claim.
- The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the number of data scientist roles to grow [$36\%$ between 2021 and 2031](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm),
- This is a clear testament to the growing significance of this field.
- But what exactly is *data science*, and why is it so pivotal in today's digital era?

1. Data + Science i.e __Science__ applied on __Data__.
2. _What is data?_ 
  - It is a collection of discrete or continuous values that convey information.
3. _What is science?_
  - It is discovering what's in there and how things work today, how they worked in the past, and how they are likely to work in the future.

- It is for everyone who is hungry to mine into data and find the insights from them to support policy.
- Then how to get started?
- You'll need to acquire a mix of skills from mathematics, statistics, computer science(Programming), and domain-specific knowledge.

- Programming is the tool that allows data scientists to work with data.
- Languages like `Python` and `R` are particularly popular due to their ease of use and powerful data handling libraries.
- Familiarity with these languages allows a data scientist to clean, process, and analyze data effectively.

- There are many programming languages available and each has specific benefits.
- R was originally created as a statistical programming language.
- R is an open source programming language (i.e anybody can contribute to its development)
- R has powerful and nearly limitless capacity in all data science cycle.
- It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

As Hadley Wickham, a prominent R developer, states:

> "R is not just a programming language, but it is also an interactive environment for doing data science. To support interaction, R is a much more flexible language than many of its peers‚Ä¶ it helps you think about problems as a data scientist, while supporting fluent interaction between your brain and the computer.(R4DS)"

- Before we get started, the first item we will cover is adding comments for code by using __#__ character.
- The first part of `RStudio` that we will work in is called the `Console`, which tells you what code `R` is running.
- We can use many of the same commands found in a calculator or Microsoft Excel.
- You can use the mathematical operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, as well as the combination of multiple basic operations.

:::
:::

> Below are three common ways to seek for more information:

::: {.incremental}
- Use a question mark followed by the function name, e.g. `?mean()`
- Use help function, e.g. `help(mean)`
- Use the help window in RStudio, then type in the function name in the box to the right of the magnifying glass and press return.

::: {.incremental}
- _Description:_ it describes the function‚Äôs mechanism, the acceptable input and output types,.
- _Usage:_ The way the function looks like.
- _Arguments:_ A detailed description of the input.
- _Details:_ A detailed description of the function. 
- _See Also:_ Some functions related or similar to this function.
- _Examples:_ Sample codes and their corresponding answers.

## Exercise

:::{.incremental}
1. Write R code to compute $\sqrt{(5 \times 5)}$
2. Write R code to get help on the function `round()`
3. Write R code to compute the square of $\pi$ and round it to 4 digits after the decimal point.
4. Write R code to compute the logarithm of 1 billion with base 1000.
5. Write R code to verify $sin^2(x)+cos^2(x)=1$ , for $x=12$.
