## Letâ€™s break down the results of the one-sample t-test:

1.  **t = 0**: This is the t-statistic, which measures how far the sample mean is from the hypothesized mean (69.8) in terms of standard errors. A t-value of 0 indicates that the sample mean is exactly equal to the hypothesized mean.

2.  **df = 4**: This is the degrees of freedom, which is calculated as the sample size minus one. In this case, the sample size is 5 (since df = 4).

3.  **p-value = 1**: The p-value indicates the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A p-value of 1 means there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, the sample mean is not significantly different from the hypothesized mean of 69.8.

4.  **Alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 69.8**: This is the alternative hypothesis being tested, which states that the true mean of the population is different from 69.8.

5.  **95 percent confidence interval: 65.46305 to 74.13695**: This interval provides a range of values within which we are 95% confident that the true population mean lies. Since 69.8 is within this interval, it further supports that there is no significant difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized mean.

6.  **Sample estimates: mean of x = 69.8**: This is the sample mean, which is 69.8 in this case.

### Interpretation:

The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized mean of 69.8. The p-value of 1 suggests that the sample data is perfectly consistent with the null hypothesis. Additionally, the 95% confidence interval includes the hypothesized mean, providing further evidence that the true mean is likely to be around 69.8.
