> Personal Information

I am really cool guy who is always have a positive mind and eagerly motivated to learn.

üéì I hold a bachelor of Sciences (Physics) with Education and two masters degrees (MSc. in Mathematical Sciences, option of Data Science and MSc. in Economics)

üë©‚Äçüé§ I am a experienced data scientist with extensive experience in leveraging data to drive impactful decisions. My strong education background and journey in data science has equipped me with a robust skill set in diverse programming languages including `R`, `Python`, `EVIEWS`, `STATA`, machine learning, and robust data analysis.

üïõÔ∏è Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, from health, economic monitoring to climate change and air quality assessment, always with a focus on using data to solve real-world problems. I am passionate about continuous learning and sharing my knowledge, which drives me to mentor aspiring data professionals and contribute to the data science community.

> Talks and Workshops

I've given several talks and workshops, many focused on Air Quality Control and Climate Change, Remote Sensing, Machine Learning and Agriculture and much more. I taught the Air Quality Data Analytics, Statistical Graphics & Visualization course through the Climate Change and Air Quality Monitoring Project at the Rwanda Environment Management Authority, [REMA](www.rpubs.com/mgisa){target="_blank"}. The course focused on data visualization using R and `openair`. Last summer, I taught the course of R package development for data management through the Cenfri Rwanda consultancy contract and give seminars at the University of Rwanda in field of Machine Learning applications.

> Grant and Project Leading

The UNESCO offered us the research grant to implement the schooling project title **Pollution Mitigation Strategies and Digital Air Quality Monitoring at Secondary School and TVET in Rwanda: Pilot study of Kigali City**. We have delivered the developed application used to monitor the air quality status through the color code indices as recommended by US-EPA. Here you can access the [SANO](https://mgisa.shinyapps.io/schoolAirNow/) application.
